# simple-python-calculator
A simple calculator made in python 

## Description
This was one of my first ever projects programming in python. I created a simple GUI calculator (with a little help from the Tkinter library). To run it, simply download both files and run the calculator.py as it is.
This project uses Python 2.7.
Making this was a lot of fun:)

Disclaimer: Some of the code was taken from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5PfbC5ld-Q, from this channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFB0dxMudkws1q8w5NJEAmw. I modified and added a bunch of my own stuff to the code as well.
