# simple-python-calculator
A simple calculator made in python 

## Description
This was one of my first ever projects programming in python. I created a simple GUI calculator (with a little help from the Tkinter library). To run it, simply download both files and run the calculator.py as it is.
This project uses Python 2.7.
Making this was a lot of fun:)
